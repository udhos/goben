Features
========

- Support for TCP and UDP.
- Can limit maximum bandwidth.
- Written in [Go](https://golang.org/). Single executable file. No runtime dependency.
- Simple usage: start the server then launch the client pointing to server's address.
- Spawns multiple concurrent lightweight goroutines to handle multiple parallel traffic streams.
- Can save test results as PNG chart.
- Can export test results in YAML format.

History
=======

- Years ago out of frustration with [iperf2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/) limitations, I wrote the [nepim](http://www.nongnu.org/nepim/) tool. One can find some known iperf problems here: [iperf caveats](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/216509388-Throughput-Testing-and-Troubleshooting#network_testing_with_open_source_tools). Nepim was more customizable, easier to use, reported simpler to understand results, was lighter on CPU.
- Later I found another amazing tool called [nuttcp](https://www.nuttcp.net/). One can read about nepim and nuttcp here: [nepim and nuttcp](https://www.linux.com/news/benchmarking-network-performance-network-pipemeter-lmbench-and-nuttcp).
- [goben](https://github.com/udhos/goben) is intended to fix shortcomings of nepim: (1) Take advantage of multiple CPUs while not wasting processing power. Nepim was single-threaded. (2) Be easily portable to multiple platforms. Nepim was heavily tied to UNIX-like world. (3) Use a simpler synchronous code flow. Nepim used hard-to-follow asynchronous architecture.

Requirements
============

- You need a [system with the Go language](https://golang.org/dl/) in order to build the application. There is no special requirement for running it.
- Dep https://github.com/golang/dep
- You can also download a binary release from https://github.com/udhos/goben/releases

Install
=======
    go get github.com/udhos/goben
    go install github.com/udhos/goben/goben

Usage
=====

Make sure ~/go/bin is in your shell PATH.

Start server:

    server$ goben

Start client:

    client$ goben -hosts 1.1.1.1 ;# 1.1.1.1 is server's address

Example
=======

Server side:

    $ goben

    2018/02/08 18:37:28 server mode (use -hosts to switch to client mode)
    2018/02/08 18:37:28 serve: spawning TCP listener: :8080
